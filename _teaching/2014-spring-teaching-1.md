Teaching assistant for ECE 490 Capstone class

Class desciption
======
The first of two design courses that must be taken in the same academic year. Student teams research, propose, design, develop, document, prototype, and present a practical engineering system or device; teams exercise creativity and make assumptions and decisions based on technical knowledge. This first course includes project definition, planning, and initial prototyping. Formal reports and presentation of the project proposal is required


Student testimonials
======
* Robert was easily the best part of ECE 490. His advice kept me on track in the course, and his knowledgeable character gave me confidence in his abilities as a TA.
* Robert was both kind and strict, in a way that made sure we were on schedule with our tasks while providing useful feedback and a positive atmosphere. His strictness was
necessary for a course like this, and his kindness made it that much more enjoyable.

Robert tended to be negative at times and not always enthusiastic about our project. He was not always able to answer our questions about design but was helpful clarifying
what the requirements of the course where. I wish Robert provided us with additional feedback regarding our weekly reports, but he more than compensated for this by
spending plenty of additional time helping us.
* Robert served as the TA of my lab section, and one of the best sources of information as to what is actually going on in the course.
He provided meaningful feedback throughout the semester, both technically and in terms of course management, and served as our source of authority as to what the course
requirements actually are. He has been highly approachable and supportive, and has made the capstone experience a lot less problematic and haphazard as the lecture
portion otherwise would have it.
I greatly look forward to continuing to work with Robert next semester in ECE 491. Robert is very nice and gives great feedback and opinions when needed! Very respectful and puts in time to understand our needs and concerns. 20 minute meetings with
him every week definitely helped us clear up many issues that we would have had otherwise. His effort is very appreciated!
* Awesome TA for our capstone class, very relatable and gave us very good feedback. Couldn't have asked for a better TA for this course
