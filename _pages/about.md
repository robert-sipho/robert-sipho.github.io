Hi! I'm Robert, currently a PhD student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Alberta] (https://www.ualberta.ca/engineering/electrical-computer-engineering/index.html). My research focuses on novel and advanced processing techniques to improve radar collection and imaging. This can involve novel antennas, different data collection strategies, or processing techniques, to solve current shortcomings in the field of microwave imaging, which will allow it to be applied to novel applications and situations. 

## Background
I received my BSc. in Engineering Physics from the University of Alberta in 2016. Since then I have been pursuing a PhD at the same institution.
