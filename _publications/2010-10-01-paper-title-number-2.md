This paper explores the competency of the time domain ultra-wideband (UWB)-circular synthetic aperture radar (CSAR) to image the breast and detect tumors. The image reconstruction is performed using a time domain global back projection technique adapted to the circular trajectory data acquisition. This paper also proposes a sectional image reconstruction method to compensate for the group velocity changes in different layers of a multilayer medium. Experiments on an advanced breast phantom examines the suitability of this technique for breast tumor imaging. The advanced breast phantom is designed based on a MRI of a real patient, fabricated using 3D printing technology, and filled with liquids that emulate normal and cancerous tissues. The measurement results, compared with MRI imaging of the phantom, demonstrate the suitability of the UWB-CSAR method for breast tumor imaging. This method can be a tool for early diagnosis as well as for treatment monitoring during chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
